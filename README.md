# Minesweeper
A repo where I publish my work trying to code a minesweeper in python

So my code is then managing both back-end and front-end

* Front-end : For the IHM, I use tkinter, which is quite tricky honestly. I have seen better for a front end language really...
   I create then buttons carrying the picture that I put in the repo, and one it is clicked, I show a picture given by the information from the back end.
   Btw, I took the pictures from a casual minesweeper : https://minesweeper.online/
   
 * Back-end : Essentially, I made a code that randomly puts bomb in a matrix with given dimensions.
   Then I wrote a code counting how many bonbs are in the encounter of the case.
   So that it creates a whole grid of pictures with bonb and the numbers around, like a casual minesweeper really.
   For now I have a problem I don't know how to fix : The first time you click on a square, it unleash all the empty one and the first line of number. 
   And that I don't know how to do it... I have an idea that I will code soon with some while loop, but nothing promissing :/

I also have to say that for some codes, I have just copied something from the net without even modifying it, it was mostly for testing the tkinter module.
